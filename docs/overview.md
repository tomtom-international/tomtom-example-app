# Open source application overview and goals

# Summary

This document captures high-level goals for the open source application.

# Overview and goals

The open source application's goal is to provide:

1. code examples to demonstrate how to use NavSDK features (ie [for the 'code reader'](./guidelines.md#terminology))
2. an application that provides a tangible demonstration of NavSDK features (
   ie [for the 'app user'](./guidelines.md#terminology))

The core considerations when making changes to the application are:

1. Ensure that the needs of both of the above goals are met
2. Code must be high quality, readable and follow guidelines (of Kotlin, NavSDK, Compose)
3. UI/UX must be based on TomTomApp's UI/UX
